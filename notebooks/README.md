# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks I created during the process of implementing the lineup decryption process. The notebooks are organized in the following way:

- `01_data-prep.ipynb`: This notebook contains the data preprocessing steps I took to prepare the data for decryption, including separating artists by lines and converting the data to a csv file.

- `02_decryption.ipynb`: This notebook contains the decryption process I used to decrypt the lineup data. The decryption process is based on the assumption that the lineup data is encrypted using a simple substitution cipher.

The data used in the notebooks is the encoded lineup from Countdown NYE 2023, which was posted as a teaser on Instagram. The assumption was made that the lineup was encrypted with a simple substitution cipher. As each character in the teaser was an obscure symbol, I manually mapped them to alphanumeric characters prior to preparing the data.
