# EDM Festival Lineup Decoder

## Description

This project is a Python application designed to decrypt EDM festival lineups encrypted with a substitution cipher. I was inspired to by the Countdown NYE 2023 lineup, which was teased on Instagram in an encrypted format. This repository includes:

- Jupyter notebooks used to develop and test the decryption logic on the Countdown NYE 2023 lineup
- Python scripts for formatting and decrypting new encrypted lineup files, ensuring reusability and efficiency

## Features
- Data Preparation: Converts raw encrypted lineup text files into a structured CSV format
- Decryption: Implements a substitution cipher decryption algorithm to convert encrypted artist names into readable formats
- Automation: Provides a streamlined pipeline for processing new encrypted files with minimal manual intervention
- Modular Code: Separates data preparation and decryption into distinct, reusable scripts

## Algorithm

The decryption algorithm is based around heuristics and assumptions about the structure of the substitution cypher encrypted text of alphanumeric characters. The two primary heuristics are:

1. Any cyphertext in parentheses of the form `(-- ---)` where each dash represents a letter and is different from the other dashes is likely to be `(DJ SET)` in the plaintext (e.g. `(QT FJG)` -> `(DJ SET)`)
2. Any three character string of the format `XYX` in the cyphertext where `X` and `Y` are different characters, and is between two artist names is likely to be `B2B` in the plaintext (e.g. `RSMVC LWL TSFOXB` -> `... B2B ...`)

Assuming both of these heuristics are present in the cyphertext, this results in a dictionary of five characters. The algorithm then iterates through each artist in the cyphertext, filling in a template with known characters (e.g. if `J` -> `E` and `G` -> `T` and the cyphertext is `HJGJD` the template is `_ETE_`).

A list of possible matches is then generated by iterating through a list of known artists (located in `data/artists.txt`) and comparing the template to the artist name. If there is only one match and the at least 50% of the artist cyphertext is known, the artist is added to the plaintext and dictionary is updated. This process is repeated until either all artists are decrypted or no new artists can be decrypted.
