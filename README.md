# EDM Festival Lineup Decoder

This project is a Python application designed to decrypt EDM festival lineups encrypted with a substitution cipher. I was inspired to by the Countdown NYE 2023 lineup, which was teased on Instagram in an encrypted format. This repository includes:

- Jupyter notebooks used to develop and test the decryption logic on the Countdown NYE 2023 lineup
- Python scripts for formatting and decrypting new encrypted lineup files, ensuring reusability and efficiency

**Note**: The decryption algorithm is based on heuristics and assumptions about the structure of the ciphertext. The algorithm is not guaranteed to work on all encrypted lineups, and may require manual intervention to decrypt certain artists.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stevenxngo/lineup-decoder
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd lineup-decoder
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Decryption

1. Place the encrypted lineup text file in the `data/ciphertext` directory

2. Run the main script to prepare the data and decrypt the artist names with the following command (replace `[filename]` with the name of the encrypted lineup file, excluding the file extension):

```bash
python main.py [filename]
```

3. The decrypted lineup will be saved in the `data/decoded_plaintext` directory

### Encryption

1. Place the plaintext lineup text file in the `data/plaintext` directory

2. Run the main script with the `-e` flag as per the following command (replace `[filename]` with the name of the plaintext lineup file, excluding the file extension):

```bash
python main.py [filename] -e
```

3. The encrypted lineup will be saved in the `data/ciphertext` directory

## Features
- Data Preparation: Converts raw encrypted lineup text files into a structured CSV format
- Decryption: Implements a substitution cipher decryption algorithm to convert encrypted artist names into readable formats
- Automation: Provides a streamlined pipeline for processing new encrypted files with minimal manual intervention
- Modular Code: Separates data preparation, decryption and encryption into distinct, reusable scripts

## Algorithm

The decryption algorithm is based around heuristics and assumptions about the structure of the substitution cypher encrypted text of alphanumeric characters. The heuristics include:

1. `(-- ---)` where each character is different is `(DJ SET)`
2. `(X---XYZ XYZ)` is `(SUNSET SET)`
3. `(Z-------- XYZ)` is `(THROWBACK SET)`
4. `... XYX ...` is `... B2B ...`

Assuming at least two of the heuristics are present in the cyphertext, this results in a starting dictionary of known mappings to create a template. The algorithm then iterates through each artist in the cyphertext, filling in a template with known characters (e.g. if `J` -> `E` and `G` -> `T` and the cyphertext is `HJGJD` the template is `_ETE_`).

A list of possible matches is then generated by iterating through a list of known artists (located in `data/artists.txt`) and comparing the template to the artist name. If there is only one match and the at least 50% of the artist cyphertext is known, the artist is added to the plaintext and dictionary is updated. This process is repeated until either all artists are decrypted or no new artists can be decrypted.
